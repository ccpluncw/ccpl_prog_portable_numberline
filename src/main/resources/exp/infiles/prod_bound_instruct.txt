In this task you will be asked to estimate numbers. 

<BR><BR>You will be presented with two vertical, parallel lines on the screen with a connecting horizontal line. This is a number line. The righthand vertical line will be labeled with a value, for example "0." The lefthand vertical line will be labeled with a larger value, for example "10.‚Äù Thus, the distance between these two vertical lines is equal to 10 units. Below the lefthand label (e.g., below the "0") you will see a third number.  This number is the <i>target number</i>. You will be asked to indicate the position on the number-line that accurately represents the target number. Below is an example of a number-line that starts at "0," ends at "10," and the target number is "1": <BR><BR>

<BR><BR> Your task is to drag the righthand (or lefthand) vertical line to the position that accurately represents the value of the target number.  In this task, you can drag the the righthand (or lefthand) vertical line inside the number-line bounds. Below is an example: <BR><BR>

<BR><BR>Dragging in this program works similar to dragging most objects on a standard computer.  Here, when you hold the mouse over the vertical line it will turn red. Click and hold down the right button of the mouse as you move the mouse.  You will notice that when you drag the line away from the boundary, the boundary will remain visible. We'll call the red, dragged line, the <i> response line</i><BR>
                                    
<BR> In the example above, the number-line goes from 0 to 10 and the target number is 1. Thus, you will place the response line in the position where you estimate a value of 1 to be. In this example, you should position the response line 1 unit to the right of the lefthand boundary labeled "0." You may move the response line to the right or left to fine tune your judgment.  You may start and stop as you wish. When you feel confident in your placement of the response line, simply release the mouse button and then hit the "space bar."  After you hit the "space bar," a new trial will begin. <BR>

<BR><BR>Please pay close attention to the unit size because it will change on every trial.  

<BR><BR> If you have any questions, please ask the experimenter at this time.
