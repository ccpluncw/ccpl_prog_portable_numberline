In this task you will be asked to estimate numbers. 

<BR><BR>You will be presented with two vertical, parallel lines on the screen with a connecting horizontal line. This is a number line. The lefthand vertical line will be labeled with a value, for example "0." The righthand vertical line will be labeled with a value exactly one unit larger than the value under the lefthand vertical line. In this example, that value would be a "1.‚Äù Thus, the distance between these two vertical lines is equal to 1 unit. Below the lefthand label (e.g., below the "0") you will see a third number.  This number is the <i>target number</i>. You will be asked to indicate the position to the right of the number-line that accurately represents the target number. Below is an example of a number-line that starts at "0," ends at "1," and the target number is "10": <BR><BR>

<BR><BR> Your task is to drag the righthand (or lefthand) vertical line to the position that accurately represents the value of the target number.  In this task, you can drag the the righthand (or lefthand) vertical line to the right of the righthand boundary. Below is an example: <BR><BR>

<BR><BR>Dragging in this program works similar to dragging most objects on a standard computer.  Here, when you hold the mouse over the vertical line it will turn red. Click and hold down the right button of the mouse as you move the mouse.  You will notice that when you drag the line away from the boundary, the boundary will remain visible. Furthermore, when you drag the line to the right of the righthand boundary, a horizontal line will emerge and move with your mouse. We'll call the red, dragged line, the <i> response line</i><BR>
                                    
<BR> In the example above, the number-line goes from 0 to 1 and the target number is 10. Thus, you will place the response line in the position where you estimate a value of 10 to be. In this example, you should position the response line 10 units to the right of the lefthand boundary labeled "0." You may move the response line to the right or left to fine tune your judgment.  You may start and stop as you wish. When you feel confident in your placement of the response line, simply release the mouse button and then hit the "space bar."  After you hit the "space bar," a new trial will begin. <BR>

<BR><BR>Please pay close attention to the unit size because it will change on every trial.  

<BR><BR> If you have any questions, please ask the experimenter at this time.
