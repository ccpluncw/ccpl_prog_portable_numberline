In this task you will be asked to estimate numbers. 

<BR><BR>You will be presented with two vertical, parallel lines on the screen with a connecting horizontal line. This is a number line. The lefthand vertical line will be labeled with a value, for example "0." The righthand vertical line will be labeled with a larger value, for example "10.‚Äù Thus, the distance between these two vertical lines is equal to 10 units.  Inside the number-line, there will also be a red, unlabeled, vertical line, called a <i>target line</i>. Here is an example: <BR><BR>

<BR><BR> Your task is judge the number that best describes the value of the red, target line.  You are to determine that number based on the placement of the red, target line in relation to the rest of the number-line. In the example above, the labeled portion of the number-line starts at 0 and ends at 10.  Given the size of the number-line, and the values of the labeled vertical lines, what is the value of the red, target line?<BR><BR>

<BR><BR>  When you feel confident that you know the value of the red, target line, simply hit the "space bar."  After you hit the "space bar," a dialogue box will appear.  You should input the value of the red, target line in the text box.  You can use any numerical value you like, including numbers with decimal values.  However, the text box will prevent you from entering non-numerical values. After you have entered your response, simply click the "OK" button and the next trial will start. <BR>

<BR><BR>Please pay close attention to the unit size because it will change on every trial.  

<BR><BR> If you have any questions, please ask the experimenter at this time.
